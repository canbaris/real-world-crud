Real World Crud is an application created to demonstrate the princples of software development covered in the great book, Real-World Software Development, by Raul Gabriel Urma and Richard Walburton, published under O'Reilly.

The main purpuse of this repository is to use as much of the best practices and principles as possible, with descriptive comments, into a Spring Boot based crud application.  It's a continuous effort to use the practices and describe them as cleanly as possible.

Work In Progress..
